# Sabiiro Snapshot

This snapshot of **Sabiiro** represents a developmental backend for Cider based on Tauri & Rust, various chunks have been removed due to correspondance in active software. It is provided solely for **research purposes** and is not intended for compilation or deployment. Key functions and data have been omitted for security reasons, and it is no longer actively maintained or used.

## Purpose

Sabiiro was the backend platform used during Cider's development. It was a full scale attempt at a backend for Cider and was briefly used (not in this form) as a suitable backend for a while before being retired to due developmental difficulties. This release allows researchers to study the architectural decisions made during its development, but it is **not suitable** for operational use.

## Security Notice

This snapshot has been stripped of sensitive functions, and the code is safe to publish under the **Cider Collective Research License (CCRL)**. Any attempts to use this code beyond research purposes are strictly prohibited, and the snapshot is provided **as-is**.

## License

This project is published under the **Cider Collective Research License (CCRL)**, restricting its use to non-commercial, research-intensive purposes only.

## Special Credit

Huge thanks to @d3rpp who participated largely in the making of this backend, you are **AWESOME**! Good luck on your future endeavors!
